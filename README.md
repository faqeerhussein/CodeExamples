# Code Examples from "Visual Programming"

This repository contains C# code examples provided in the booklet **"Visual Programming" by Faqeer Hussain**. The examples are organized into multiple projects within a single directory. 

## Running the Examples

To run the example code, you need to use the `dotnet` CLI command. Since the repository contains multiple projects, you must specify the project name when running the command. Below is the general format for running a project:

```bash
dotnet run --project <project_filename.csproj>
```

## Example

For example to run the example code about variables, run the following command:

```bash
dotnet run --project variables.csproj
```

And to run the example code about ternary_operator, run the following command:

```bash
dotnet run --project ternary_operator.csproj
```
